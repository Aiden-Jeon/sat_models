Speculations about the meaning and purpose of prehistoric art rely heavily on analogies drawn with modern-day hunter-gatherer societies. 	1	2020	짝수형	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	1
Such primitive societies,  as Steven Mithen emphasizes in The Prehistory of the Modern Mind, tend to view man and beast, animal and plant, organic and inorganic spheres, as participants in an integrated, animated totality. 	1	2020	짝수형	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	2
The dual expressions of this tendency are anthropomorphism (the practice of regarding animals as humans) and totemism (the practice of regarding humans as animals), both of which spread through the visual art and the mythology of primitive cultures. 	1	2020	짝수형	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	3

Suppose we know that Paula suffers from a severe phobia. 	1	2020	짝수형	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	0
If we reason that Paula is afraid either of snakes or spiders, and then establish that she is not afraid of snakes, we will conclude that Paula is afraid of spiders. 	1	2020	짝수형	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	1
However, our conclusion is reasonable only if Paula’s fear really does concern either snakes or spiders. 	1	2020	짝수형	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	0
If we know only that Paula has a phobia, then the fact that she’s not afraid of snakes is entirely consistent with her being afraid of heights, water, dogs or the number thirteen. 	1	2020	짝수형	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	2
More generally, when we are presented with a list of alternative explanations for some phenomenon, and are then persuaded that all but one of those explanations are unsatisfactory, we should pause to reflect. 	1	2020	짝수형	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	3

To begin with a psychological reason, the knowledge of another’s personal affairs can tempt the possessor of this information to repeat it as gossip because as unrevealed information it remains socially inactive.	1	2020	9월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	1
Only when the information is repeated can its possessor turn the fact that he knows something into something socially valuable like social recognition, prestige, and notoriety.	1	2020	9월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	2
As long as he keeps his information to himself, he may feel superior to those who do not know it.	1	2020	9월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	3
But knowing and not telling does not give him that feeling of “superiority that, so to say, latently contained in the secret, fully actualizing itself only at the moment of disclosure.”	0	2020	9월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	4

One misconception that often appears in the writings of physical scientists who are looking at biology from the outside is that the environment appears to them to be a static entity, which cannot contribute new bits of information as evolution progresses.	1	2020	9월	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	0
This, however, is by no means the case.	1	2020	9월	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	0
Far from being static, the environment is constantly changing and offering new challenges to evolving populations.	1	2020	9월	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	1
For higher organisms, the most significant changes in the environment are those produced by the contemporaneous evolution of other organisms.	1	2020	9월	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	0
The evolution of a horse’s hoof from a five-toed foot has enabled the horse to gallop rapidly over open plains.	1	2020	9월	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	2
But such galloping is of no advantage to a horse unless it is being chased by a predator. 	1	2020	9월	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	3
The horse’s efficient mechanism for running would never have evolved except for the fact that meat-eating predators were at the same time evolving more efficient methods of attack. 	1	2020	9월	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	4
Consequently, laws based upon ecological relationships among different kinds of organisms are optional for understanding evolution and the diversity of life to which it has given rise.	0	2020	9월	30	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은? 	5
An interesting aspect of human psychology is that we tend to like things more and find them more appealing if everything about those things is not obvious the first time we experience them.	1	2020	6월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	1
This is certainly true in music. For example, we might hear a song on the radio for the first time that catches our interest and decide we like it.	1	2020	6월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	2
Then the next time we hear it, we hear a lyric we didn’t catch the first time, or we might notice what the piano or drums are doing in the background.	1	2020	6월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	3
